# Welcome to my small-project repository ðŸŒ´
As a passionate frontend developer, I thrive in the dynamic world of technology.

During my intensive six-months at Green Fox Academy, I delved into a comprehensive full-stack development bootcamp. 
This experience honed my skills across both front-end and back-end development, with a specialized focus on Spring Framework and React.

Here, you'll discover some of my smaller projects!
