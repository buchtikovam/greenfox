                    How to see a newly discovered green comet this week, 
                    before it vanishes for 400 years
                </h1>
                <p>
                    A newly discovered green comet is zipping by Earth and 
                    is now visible for the first time in more than 400 years.
                    Comet Nishimura was discovered by amateur Japanese astronomer 
                    Hideo Nishimura on Aug. 11 and named after him. Nishimura 
                    first spotted it by taking long exposure shots using a 
                    Canon digital camera and a telephoto lens.

                    What we know about Kim Jong Un's train — 
                    a slow-moving bulletproof fortress
                </h1>
                <p>
                    On Monday, a dark green train with yellow trim was spotted 
                    at the border where Russia, China and North Korea meet. 
                    Its distinctive coloring identified it as a one-of-a-kind 
                    vehicle that runs with one passenger in mind: the leader of 
                    North Korea, Kim Jong Un.</p>

                </h1>
                <p>A handful of wildlife enthusiasts were probably hoping to catch 
                    a glimpse of Katmai National Park's famous brown bears when 
                    they logged on to a livestream of a remote Alaska mountaintop 
                    last Tuesday. But the resident celebrities were nowhere to be 
                    seen when a distressed hiker walked into view instead and 
                    pleaded for help.</p>

                    on Tuesday to announce they've signed up to the voluntary AI commitments
                    , the White House said — pledges that are seen as a "bridge" to government 
                    action.
